The SCAP Compliance Checker is an automated compliance scanning tool that leverages the
DISA Security Technical Implementation Guidelines (STIGs) and operating system (OS) specific
baselines to analyze and report on the security configuration of an information system. The tool
can be run locally on the host system to be scanned, or scans can be conducted across a network
from any machine on the domain. In either scanning environment, the following requirement
applies: The user conducting the scan must have administrative privileges on the machine to be
scanned. If the machine to be scanned is not hosting the tool, domain-level administrative
privileges (or individual local administrator accounts) are required to remotely scan other systems
on the network.
