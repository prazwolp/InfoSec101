Cisco assembled a large team of security practitioners called Cisco Talos to provide actionable intelligence, visibility of indicators, and protection against emerging threats through data collected from their products. (https://talosintelligence.com/)

Cisco Talos encompasses six key items:

  - Threat Intelligence & Interdiction: Quick correlation and tracking of threats provide a means to turn simple IOCs into context-rich intel.
  - Detection Research: Vulnerability and malware analysis is performed to create rules and content for threat detection.
  - Engineering & Development: Provides the maintenance support for the inspection engines and keeps them up-to-date to identify and triage emerging threats.
  - Vulnerability Research & Discovery: Working with service and software vendors to develop repeatable means of identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.
  - Communities: Maintains the image of the team and the open-source solutions.
  - Global Outreach: Disseminates intelligence to customers and the security community through publications
