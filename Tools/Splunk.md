You can also create visualizations such as dashboards. Splunk has a number of server components that run on different platforms. You can also work with Splunk as a managed cloud service. Splunk also allows you to automate alert notifications. 

SIEM solution is like a large funnel into which all IT services report their usage infromation and performance metrics to. SIEM capabilities include centralized security monitoring and data analytics and data corelation. SIEM enterprise solution collect data from a variety of different sources, so it gets funneled into a centralized location where data analysis and correlation takes place. So, for example through machine learning if there is suspicious behavior, an alert will be generated. Data analysis and correlation can be used for threat detection. Threat detection is something that can change over time, for instance if it was normal to have only Windows hosts and now all of a sudden the organization has started seeing Linux hosts then it can generate an alert. Now the organization could have just added a new workstation so we can stop having alerts for those events.
