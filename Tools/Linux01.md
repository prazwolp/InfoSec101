`Linux Privilege Escalation` 

 We will be using TryHackme for this course. The room that we will be using will be the "linuxprivescarena". The link for this room is "https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxprivescarena". In this room we will ssh into a linux and see how we can escalate privileges once we have access to the linux machine. 
 
 We will also be using a Github Repo in order to get resource that we will need in order to escalate the privileges in the machine. The link is as follows:
