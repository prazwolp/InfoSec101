`MITRE ATT&CK` 
It is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real world observations. The attack knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. It is a guideline for classifying and describing cyberattacks and intrusions. It was created by the Mitre Corporation and released in 2013. 

The framework consists of 14 tactics and categories consisting of "technical objectives" of an adversary. These categories are then further broken down into specific techniques and sub-techniques.
