Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer or an application that captures packets from a network connection such as from your home office or the internet. Packet is a name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network. 

Wireshark is the most used packet sniffer in the world. It has the following functions:

`1. Packet Capture` - Wireshark listend to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic i.e. thousands of packets at a time. 

`2. Filtering` - Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information that you need                  to see. 

`3. Visualization` - Wireshark like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire                              conversations and network streams. 


Wireshark is for example using a flashlight to look for something inside a cave. The network is the cave and wireshark is the tool that is used like a flashlight to look for things inside the cave. Wireshark is used for many uses, including troubleshooting networks that have performance issues. InfoSec professionals often use Wireshark to trace connections, view the contents of suspect network transactions and identify bursts of network traffic. 

For our example we will be using a file called `magnitude_1hr.pcap`. The `.pcap` extension file are PCAP files which are data files created using a program. These files contain packets of data of a network and are used to analyze the network characterstics. They also contribute to controlling the network traffic and determininig network status.
