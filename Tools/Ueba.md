`User Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)` 

UEBA is a cybersecurity solution that uses algorithms and machine learning to detect anamolies in the behavior of not only the users in a corporate network but also the routers, servers and endpoints in that network. 

UEBA seeks to recognize any peculiar or suspicious behavior instances where there are irregularities from normal everyday patterns or usage. For example, if a particular user on a network regularly downloads files of 50 MB every day but starts downloading 5GB of files the UEBA system would consider this an anamoly and either alert an IT administrator, or if automations are in pace, automatically disconnect the user from the network. 

UEBA not only monitors human behavior but also monitors machines. A server in one branch office may suddenly received thousands more requests than usual one day, signalling the start of a potential distributed denial of service attacks, there is a chnace IT administrators might not notice this type of activity, but UEBA would recognize it and take further action. 

For a UEBA solution to be effective, it must be installed on every device used by or connected to every employee across the organization. This includes devices not only owned by the company but also owned by the employee, as even devices used part time can be targets of a cyberattack. Some organizations may also request that employees install the UEBA solution on their home routers. 

After installation the UEBA goes silent as it starts collecting data on device and network usage. In `learning mode`, the UEBA solutions algorithms will determine and further define what is considered normal or even optimal. IT admins decide how long the learning mode will last before the system goes into testing mode. 

The three main componenets of a UEBA Solution are as follows: 

   `Analytics ->`
                collects and organizaes data on what is determined to be normal behavior of users and entities. The system builds profiles of how each normally acts                         regarding application usage, communication and download actiivity, and network activity. Statistical models are then formulated and applied to detect                       unusual behavior.
                
   `Integration ->`
                 Intergrate with other security products and systems already in place is a must as organizations grow and evolve. They most likely have a security stake in                  place, which may include legacy systems that may not keep up with today's ever-increasing threat landscape. The beauty of UEBA is that it is not meant to                    obviate existing security products in use across the enterprise. With proper integration, UEBA systems are able to compare data collected from various                      sources, including logs, packet capture data, and other datasets, and integrate these to make the sytem more robust.  
                 
   `Presentation ->`
                 It is the process of communicating the findings of the UEBA system and devising an appropriate response. This can vary between organizations, some UEBA                      systems will simply create an alert, either for the employee or the IT administrator, to suggest further investigation. Other UEBA systems will be set up                    to take immediate action - by automatically shutting off network connectivity for the at employee due to a suspected cyberattack, for example.
