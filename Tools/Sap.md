`Special Access Programs (SAP)` 

Executive Order 13526 (Classified National Security Infromation) defines a Special Access Program (SAP) as a program established for a specific class of classified information that imposes safeguarding and access requirements exceeding those normally required for information at the same classification level. SAPs are established only when the program is required by statute, or upon finding of exceptional vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information, and if the normal criteria for determining access to information classified at the same level are insufficient. SAPs use the standard level of classified information, that is, Top Secret,Secret, and Confidential. SAPs also require an assigned nickname and/or codeword and Identification of any special handling procedures. In simplest terms, a SAP is a classified program with enhanced safeguarding and access requirements. 

`Why do we use SAPs?` 
SAPs are important for several reasons

  -some are used to protect technology breakthroughs and ensure the U.S maintains its leading technological edge. 
  
  -Once a adversary's vulnerability is discovered, a SAP is used to ensure that the knowledge of the exploitation remains secure and the adversary does not develop a 
    countermeasure. 
    
  -Some SAPs are established to ensure sensitive operational plans are completed without disclosure. Some protect intelligent information, which is often the key to a    
    succesful mission. 
    
  -Reducing the amount of intelligence gathered on U.S forces significantly enhances our success on the battlefield. 

`The goal of SAP is to employ enhanced security measures beyond those required in baseline configurations and directives. To protect the work of SAPs, the number of personnel who have access to a SAP is kept to a minimum. Records of individuals who have or have had access to a SAP are maintained.` 

`Need to know` is a fundamental principle when it comes of SAPs. it is not enough to have the appropriate clearance and formal approval to access a SAP.
