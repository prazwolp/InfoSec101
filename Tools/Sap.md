`Special Access Programs (SAP)` 

Executive Order 13526 (Classified National Security Infromation) defines a Special Access Program (SAP) as a program established for a specific class of classified information that imposes safeguarding and access requirements exceeding those normally required for information at the same classification level. SAPs are established only when the program is required by statute, or upon finding of exceptional vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information, and if the normal criteria for determining access to information classified at the same level are insufficient. SAPs use the standard level of classified information, that is, Top Secret,Secret, and Confidential. SAPs also require an assigned nickname and/or codeword and Identification of any special handling procedures. In simplest terms, a SAP is a classified program with enhanced safeguarding and access requirements. 

`Why do we use SAPs?` 

SAPs are important for several reasons

  -some are used to protect technology breakthroughs and ensure the U.S maintains its leading technological edge. 
  
  -Once a adversary's vulnerability is discovered, a SAP is used to ensure that the knowledge of the exploitation remains secure and the adversary does not develop a 
    countermeasure. 
    
  -Some SAPs are established to ensure sensitive operational plans are completed without disclosure. Some protect intelligent information, which is often the key to a    
    succesful mission. 
    
  -Reducing the amount of intelligence gathered on U.S forces significantly enhances our success on the battlefield. 

   The goal of SAP is to employ enhanced security measures beyond those required in baseline configurations and directives. To protect the work of SAPs, the number of  
     personnel who have access to a SAP is kept to a minimum. Records of individuals who have or have had access to a SAP are maintained.
     
   Need to know is a fundamental principle when it comes of SAPs. it is not enough to have the appropriate clearance and formal approval to access a SAP.
   
   `SAP Lifecycle and Structure` 
   
   Section 119 of Total 10 Specifies the types of reports that are submitted to Congress as well as the frequency with which they are submitted. Existing SAPs must submit an annual report to Congress no later than March 1 of each year. Reports for existing SAPs include 
    - estimated total budget requested for the current and next fiscal years
    - a brief description of the program including the number of individuals involved 
    - a brief discussion of the major milestones for the SAP such as current issues or significant changes 
    - actual cost of the program for each previous fiscal year 
    
 `Types of SAP` 
 
 SAPs are categorized both by how they are protected and acknowledged (referred to as a SAP Protection level) & type of program they encompass(referred by SAP Category). 
 Every SAP within the DoD will fall under both a protection level and a category. A protection level communicates how the SAP is acknowledged and protected. 
 
   - A SAP that is acknowledged is one whose existence is openly recognized. However, the details of the program inluding its technologies, materials and techniques are classified and dictated by their vulnerability to exploitation and the risk of compromise. The funding is generally unclassified. 
    
   - An Unacknowledged SAP is one whose existence and purpose are protected. The details of the program uncluding its technologies, materials and techniques are classified. The funding is often classified, unacknowledged or not directly linked to a program. 
    
   - Waived SAPs are unacknowledgde SAPs for which the Secretary of Defense has waived applicable reporting requirements under Section 119, Title 10 U.S Code. Waived SAPs have more restrictive requirements and access controls. 

Along with protection level, SAPs also fall under three possible categories:

  - 75% - 80% of all DoD SAPs are acquisition SAPs. They are established to protect sensitive research, development, testing and evaluation, modification or procurement. They involved buying or building something such as weapon system or aircraft. Vast majority of them are Acquisition SAPS. 
  - Intelligence SAPs are established primarily to protect the planning and execution of especially sensitive Intelligence or CI operations of collection activities
  - Operation and Support SAPs are established primarily to protect the planning for, execution of, and support to especially sensitive military operations which often involve the use of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines and they may protect organizations, property, operations, concepts, etc. 
    
    `SAP Life Cycle` 
    
    - Established ->  is the phase when it is determined whether or not exta protection is warranted to become a SAP or to establish a protected SAP (PSAP). The establishing SAPCO must notify the Director, DoD SAPCO, in writing of a decision to create a PSAP. Documents are created to ensure the SAPs protection, and its program eligibility to become a SAP is evaluated through the approval process. Once it is approved, it moves on to the next phase. 
    - Management & Administration Phase -> This is where the work of the SAP is accomplished  as long as there is a continued need for the SAP.
