Now that we have the shell, we will look into ways in which we will try to exploit the system. When we have a meterpreter session, we can use $`bg` to come in and out of the meterpreter sessions. Sometimes we can have multiple sessions open so to go back and forth we do $`sessions 2` in order to get the session where we want to go. $`sessions` is used to see what sessions we have opened and this is done outside of the session itself in msfconsole. $`msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > sessions`. This will display all the sessions that we have opened. In order to take a screenshot in the victim computer, we hit $`screenshot` once we do that it will give us a display of the screenshot of the victim machine. It will save it in the home/kali folder.
