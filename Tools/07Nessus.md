Nessus is a remote security scanning tool developed by Tenebale Inc that scans a computer and raises an alerts if it discovers any vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could use to gain access to any computer you have connected to a network. It is a great tool that help keeps their domains free of the easy vulnerabilities that hackers and viruses commonly look to exploit. 
Nessus is an open-source vulnerability scanner that uses the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure architecture for easy cross-linking between compliant security tools. It is one of the many vulneraility scanners used during vulnerability assessments and penetration testing engagements, including malicious attacks. 
Nessus works by testing each port on a computer, determining what service it is running, and then testing this service to make sure there are no vulnerbilities in it that could be used by a hacker to carry out a malicious attack. 
Nessus can scan these vulnerabilities and exposures:

    Vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized control or access to sensitive data on a system
    Misconfiguration (e.g. open mail relay)
    Denials of service (Dos) vulnerabilities
    Default passwords, a few common passwords, and blank/absent passwords on some system accounts
