Now that we have the shell, we will look into ways in which we will try to exploit the system. When we have a meterpreter session, we can use $`bg` to come in and out of the meterpreter sessions. Sometimes we can have multiple sessions open so to go back and forth we do $`sessions 2` in order to get the session where we want to go. $`sessions` is used to see what sessions we have opened and this is done outside of the session itself in msfconsole. $`msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > sessions`. This will display all the sessions that we have opened. In order to take a screenshot in the victim computer, we hit $`screenshot` once we do that it will give us a display of the screenshot of the victim machine. It will save it in the home/kali folder. 
There are many things that we can do in the meterpreter session in order to utilitze the shell that we have. To see the full list of all the functions we can use. We type in $`help`. We can start a keylogger in order to see what passwords we can use. In order to do so we type in $`keyscan_start`. This will start logging all the keystrokes the victim is typing on. In order to see what they typed we will do a $`keyscan_dump` We can see what they typed and in order to stop it, we do $`keyscan_stop`.
