The Risk Management Framework or RMF is the common information security framework for the federal government. 

RMF Governance 

![rmf gov](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93686063/219705504-af316948-4dd6-4836-b606-e6704020bc2a.JPG)

$`RMF Governance`

`The complex, many-to-many relationships among mission or business processes and the information systems supporting those processes require a holistic, organization-wide view for managing risk. A holistic approach requires the management of risk at both the enterprise-level and system-level. This approach takes into account the organization as a whole, including strategic goals and objectives and relationships between mission/business processes and the supporting information systems. 

Organizational culture and infrastructure should also be considered. The security controls and safeguards selected by the organization must take into account: 
-> potential mission and business impacts;
-> risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations and the Nation. 

Those roles and responsbilities have been delegated enterprise wide and are arranged into tiers.`

`Tier 1` 
Tier 1 is the Office of the secretary of Defense and or Strategic Level and it addresses risk management at the DOD Enterprise level. The key governance elements in Tier 1 are:
 - DOD Senior Information Security Officer, or SISO 
 - Risk Executive function
 - DOD Cybersecurity Architecture
 - The RMF tag 
 - The Knowledge Service(KS) 

`Tier 2` 
Tier 2 is the Mission Area and component levels and addresses risk management at these levels. The key governance element in Tier 2 is the Principal Authorizing Official, or PAO, DOD Chief Information Officer, or CIO and DOD Component SISO. 

`Tier 3` 
Tier 3, Information system, or IS, and Platform Technology, or PIT Systems, consists of AO as well as that IS or PIT System Cybersecurity Program. 

`Knowledge Check` 
1. What policy governs CyberSecurity? 
  - DODI 8510.01 
  - CNSSI 1253
  - NIST SP 800-37 
  - DODI 8500.01 (DOD follows the DOD 8500 series documentation for cybersecurity policy) 

2. DOD participates in ______ and ______ as a vested stakeholder to create a more standardized approach to Cybersecurity. Select the best answer. 
  - Platform and Organization
  - CNSS and NIST (DOD participates in CNSS and NIST policy development as a vested stakeholder for a standardized approach) 
  - Tier 1 and Tier 3 
  - RMF and NISPOM 
 
 3. What factors do organizations need to take into account when implementing a holistic apporach to organizational risk management? 
   - Supporting Information Systems 
   - Relationships between mission/business process 
   - Strategic Goals and Objectives
   - All of the above ( A holistic approach takes into account all of the factors mentioned above) 
 

 $`DOD Information Technology(IT)` 
 
 ![DOD IT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93686063/219732985-97252184-737e-40c4-99eb-65a41927af8c.JPG)
 
 DOD Information Technology refers to all DOD owned IT or DOD controlled IT that receives, processes, stores, displays, or transmits DOD information. The forms of DOD IT range in size and complexity from individual hardware and software products to stand-alone systems to massive computing environments, enclaves, and networks. IT products, services and PIT(Platform Information Technology) are not authorized for operation through the full RMF process. These types of IT must be securely configured in accordance with applicable DOD policies and security controls and undergo special assessment of their functional and security related capabilities and deficiences. 
 
`Knowledge Check` 

1. PIT system refers to PIT stands for Platform Information Tech, a category of DOD IT that refers to all DOD-owned IT or DOD-controlled IT that receives, processes, stores, displays, or transmits DOD information. 
2. What broad group does DOD use to categorize information technology? Select all that apply. 
 - IT products 
 - PIT 
 - Infromation Systems 
 - IT services
 All of the above are correct answers.

Seven Step Information Security Lifecycle 

`Prepare` 

Prepare is the first key step in the RMF because of its effect on all other steps in the framework, from categorization of security controls to level of effort in assessing security control effectiveness. The purpose of the Prepare step is to carry out essential activities at the org, mission and business process, and information system levels of organizations to help prepare the organization to manage its security and privacy risks using the RMF. 

`Categorize` 

The purpose of the categorize step is to inform organizational risk management processes and tasks by determining the adverse impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation with respect to the loss of confidentiality, intergrity and availability of organizational systems and the information processed, stored and transmitted by those systems. 

`Implement` 

The purpose of the implement step is to implement the controls in the security and privacy plans for the system and for the organization and to document in a baseline configuration, the specific details of hte control implementation. 

`Assess` 

The purpose of the assess step is to determine if the controls selected for implementation are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system and the organization. 

`Authorize` 

The purpose of the Authorize step is to provide organizational accountability by requiring a senior management official to determine if the security and privacy risk (including supply chain risk) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation based on the operation of a system or the use of common control, is acceptable. Authorize steps include Information types, system registration, asset identification, system stakeholders. 

`Monitor` 

The purpose of the Monitor Step is to maintain an ongoing situational awareness about the security and privacy posture of the information system and the organization in support of risk management decisions. 

$`RMF and DOD IT Acquisition`

The RMF is designed to be complementary to and supportive of DOD's acquisition management system activities, milestones, and phases. RMF activities should be initiated as early as possible in the DOD acquisition process to increase security and decrease cost. Requirements development, procurement, and test and evaluation, also known as T&E, processess should be considered in applying the RMF to the acquisition of DOD IT. Threats to these systems should be designed consistent with the most severe risk to any individual component or subcomponent for consideration of requirements, acquisition, and testing and evaluation.
