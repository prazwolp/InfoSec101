$`RMF Governance`

`The complex, many-to-many relationships among mission or business processes and the information systems supporting those processes require a holistic, organization-wide view for managing risk. A holistic approach requires the management of risk at both the enterprise-level and system-level. This approach takes into account the organization as a whole, including strategic goals and objectives and relationships between mission/business processes and the supporting information systems. 

Organizational culture and infrastructure should also be considered. The security controls and safeguards selected by the organization must take into account: 
-> potential mission and business impacts;
-> risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations and the Nation. 

Those roles and responsbilities have been delegated enterprise wide and are arranged into tiers.`
