The OSI Model or the Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization of Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. It is based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each stacked one upon the last.

The goal of OSI model is to understand how networking works between one host to another. 


`Physical layer ->  The goal is to transfer bits from one end to another, some examples of what helps transport these bits is Ethernet cable, coaxial cable and fiber cables. Although Wifi does not use wire, it is still considered Layer 1. Repeater is something that is used to extend a wire. Multi port repeater called hub is also Layer 1 technology.` 

`Data Link Layer -> Interacts with the wire, put bits on the wire and retrieve bits from the wire. So for example Network Interface cards, wifi access cards are considered Layer 2. The goal of Layer 2 is Hop to Hop meaning, it stands to move 1's and 0's from one NIC to another NIC. In order to make this possible, Layer 2 uses addressing schemes which is known as MAC Addresses. MAC addresses are 48 bits which are represented as 12 hex digits. Windows machines typically use dashes in between mac addresses such as (94-65-9C-3B-8A-E5), Linux machines typically use colons(94:65:9C:3B:8A:E5), Cisco routers typically use 4 hex digits with a dot in between(9465.9C3B.8AE5).`
