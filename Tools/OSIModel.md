The OSI Model or the Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization of Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. It is based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each stacked one upon the last.
