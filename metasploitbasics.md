MetaSploit Framework 

MetaSploit is a Ruby based modular penetration testing platform that enables you to write, test & execute exploit code. Metasploit contains a set of tools that you can use to 

- test security vulnerabilities

- enumerate networks ( process that involves gathering information about a network such as hosts, connected devices along with usernames, group info and related data) 

In order to start metasploit in Linux, the following commands need to be entered first. 

- service postgresql start ( to start the database) 
- service postgresql status (to check the status of the database wether it has started or not) 
- msfdb init (this is to initialize the database) 
- msfconsole (this starts the msfconsole) 

$ `sudo su-`
