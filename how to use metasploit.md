The first thing you do in terms of enumeration is using tools like NMap to find out what ports are open and what OS the system is using and what vulnerabilities we can find in order to exploit the system. Once we find the OS or the browser whose exploit is available in msfconsole we go ahead and start the process. 
The things we need to look for when we first find how we are going to exploit the system are the following things: 

$`RHOST -- This is the victim machine` 

$`LHOST -- This is the machine that we are attacking from, in our case the kali Linux` 

$`RPORT -- The target port`
